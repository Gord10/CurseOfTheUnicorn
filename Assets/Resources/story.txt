You are a benelovent witch that lives in a cursed realm where the evil roams free.
One day you found a newborn unicorn who had just lost her mother.
Dark spirits are the natural foes of the unicorns.
It's clear who killed the mother unicorn.
You swore that you'll protect the baby unicorn, the innocence, from the evil that are after her.
Even though you know you will not succeed.
